    "##### Summary:\n",
    "An ecommerce company that sells clothing online, also has an in-store style and clothing advice service. Customers typically come in to the store and have sessions with a personal stylist who provides them some style guidance. They can then go home and order clothing either on a mobile app or website.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Challenge:\n",
    "The company is trying to decide whether to focus their annual budget on their mobile app experience or their website. Your role as data scientist on this project is to help them determine the best strategic approach to investing. Using EDA, Statistical Analysis, and any other knowledge gained up until this point to inform your advice to the client. \n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the steps below to analyze the customer data. These steps are not necessarily the 'correct' sequence of steps but more a quideline on what you could do to get to some kind of answer.\n",

    "**(Not to worry; All the data provided is fabricated, but in a real-life situation the data you could be dealing with here is considered to fall under the designation of PII. Keep this in mind when working on projects out in the real world)**\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Client Simulation:\n",
    "**Each team will have 1.5 hours to run the analysis and formulate a pitch. Each team will have 5 minutes with the client advising them as how to best proceed with investement**\n",
