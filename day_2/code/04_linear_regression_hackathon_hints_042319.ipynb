    "An ecommerce company that sells clothing online, also has an in-store style and clothing advice service. Customers typically come in to the store and have sessions with a personal stylist who provides them some style guidance. They can then go home and order clothing either on a mobile app or website.\n",

    "The company is trying to decide whether to focus their annual budget on their mobile app experience or their website. Your role as data scientist on this project is to help them determine the best strategic approach using your machine learning knowledge.\n",
